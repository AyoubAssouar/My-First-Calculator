# My First Python Calculator 🧮

This is my very first Python program - a functional calculator built while learning programming. I created this project to understand basic Python concepts and start my journey toward becoming a software engineer.

## 🚀 Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)
- **Advanced Operations**: Modulo (%), Integer Division (//)
- **Error Handling**: Prevents division by zero
- **User-Friendly**: Clear prompts and formatted output
- **Clean Display**: Shows calculations in easy-to-read format

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. **Ensure Python is installed** (Python 3.6 or higher)
2. **Download** the `calculator.py` file
3. **Open terminal/command prompt** in the file's directory
4. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
🧠 What I Learned
Through this project, I gained practical experience with:

Python Basics: Variables, input/output, type conversion

Conditional Logic: if/elif/else statements

Error Handling: Preventing division by zero

String Formatting: f-strings for clean output

Problem Solving: Breaking down complex tasks into steps
🎯 Why I Built This
As a 15-year-old student from Morocco aiming for a career at NVIDIA, this calculator represents my first step toward mastering:

Programming fundamentals in Python

Logical thinking and problem-solving

Project development from idea to working code

This project is part of my 10-year plan to become a systems engineer specializing in high-performance computing and networking.

📈 Future Improvements
Planned features for version 2.0:

Continuous calculation mode

Memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)

Support for parentheses and complex expressions

Graphical User Interface (GUI)

History of calculations
